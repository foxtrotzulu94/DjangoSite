# Django Project for Personal Website

Small Django app that powers my personal site. Made to be extremely basic and extensible while providing some extended functionality


## Installation

This app comes packed with a virtualenv that contains everything needed to run.

If you don't want to use the virtualenv, install Python 3, Django and Pillow to run successfully

## Running the App

The app requires either Debug to be true or a Secret Key to be provided
For development/debugging, run with
* Linux: `env DEBUG=1 python3 manage.py runserver`
* Windows: `set DEBUG=True && python manage.py runserver`
